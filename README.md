a simple python script that fills the johnny cash API i made

A simple python webscraper that gathers all entries on the johnnycash website : https://www.johnnycash.com/releases/song-list/
I had to add some code that made it only start POST'ing to my API when it reached a certain song because the database dropped out mid script due to my own errors.
