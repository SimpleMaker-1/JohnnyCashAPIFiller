# JohnnyCashAPIFiller
a simple python script that fills the johnny cash API i made

A simple python webscraper that gathers all entries on the johnnycash website : https://www.johnnycash.com/releases/song-list/
And fills the api I created at: https://johnny-cash-api-de4ecab074cf.herokuapp.com/
This Script is NOT intended for others to use, It is simply a showcase of how I made a script to finish my API.
